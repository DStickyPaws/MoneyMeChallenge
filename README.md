# MoneyMeChallenge

## Introduction
Hi All this is the money me challenge. This was provided to me by MoneyMe. It uses C# for the server and Angular 15 for the client. The directory is self explanatory. To run the server clone the repository and then perform a dotnet restore. Once completed you can simply do a dotnet run within the directory. This server uses Swashbuckler. For the Client simply clone the client and do and npm install or npm i after all packages are installed you can run the application by doing an ng serve -o command.
